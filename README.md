# A BASIC RUN TRACKER FOR SHOGUN SHOWDOWN PROLOGUE

this is a prototype that track in somewhat real time the progress of the player.
So far i only 

## HOW TO USE
not very pratical for most people i agree however:

- It's a python3 script, run it as so

- in runtracker.py there is a "directory" variable, setup it to your game file location:
	- linux (and probably macOS): `~/.config/unity3d/Roboatino/ShogunShowdownPrologue/`
	- windows: somewhere around `%APPDATA%/../LocalLow/Roboatino/ShogunShowdown` i dunno i don't have a windows

- once you get it running and it doesn't yell at you that means you can start to play
and as long the program is running it should record some the first 3 bosses death

### Features so far
tracks the time of the death of bosses, namely spiker, impaler and ume.
